WIP Game Title: SmartShot

Group Members: Colin Treziok, Luke Zingale

Current target for game: Our current goal is to have this be a combination puzzle game and horde shooter, fighting off waves of enemies while advancing through areas by solving puzzles. Our current plan is to have these elements of the gameplay integrated thoroughly, such as by having your gun and melee weapon also double as tools for interfacing with the puzzle elements. Aesthetically, the game is currently planned to have a scifi theme, though we haven't begun pulling assets together yet, as we've mainly been focusing on putting together the base mechanical systems first.
  
Goals per person:

Luke: I want to make sure the puzzle and shooting elements are satisfying in combination. I've been brainstorming ways to integrate manipulating individual enemies or groups of them into puzzles, such as needing to shoot an enemy to keep it on top of a button.

Colin: I intend to make an interesting level where there are compelling environmental puzzles in each room or area that the player needs to solve before being able to move onto the next. I want the player to have to seach the whole room in order to find the intended answer and want the enemies to actually pose as a soft timer where more and more flood the area in order to push the player to solve the puzzles quickly and add a sense of pressure.
